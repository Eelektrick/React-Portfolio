Next in the top right corner you can click to go learn about me,

to view my resume, to find how to contact me, or go to my porfolio

page to see my top designs and test how they work and look at the code

that operates each design and webpage.

On the portfolio page beside the links to test the code or to see the code

# Issues

Had to take little steps, when trying to rebuild entire site was overwhelmed with the thought of everything.

However started with the easier pages and less information to move over first. Doing this helped me get a better

understanding on how react works and the different ways you can break down the code for each part of the page.

started making components for the footer and header/nav bar. which helped set the foundation on how I was going

to break down my code. My portfolio page was the most difficult and fought for a full day trying to get the code to work.

not quite as identical due to how I was moving the information over but I am happy how it turned out and like the look as much

as the original look. Learned making the json file capitilizes as Json instead of json caused issues with the multiple files that

run the json file loader. next had to switch all my modal code into the react-bootstrap version and also the bavbar button had to

add additional code to be able to work in react. Even though the code is easier to see and manage I had to add extra code or 

completely start new to make the code work in react.
